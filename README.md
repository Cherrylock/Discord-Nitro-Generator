# Discord Nitro Code Generator

This is a Python script that generates Discord Nitro codes and checks their validity using Discord's API. It employs multithreading to speed up the process and includes support for custom user agents for added anonymity.

## Features

- Generates random Discord Nitro codes
- Checks the validity of generated codes via Discord's API
- Multithreaded execution for faster processing
- Uses custom user agents for improved anonymity
- Writes valid codes to a file for later use

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library (`pip install requests`)
- `termcolor` library (`pip install termcolor`)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Cherrylock/Discord-Nitro-Generator.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

   ```bash
   cd discord-nitro-generator
   ```

3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python nitrogen.py
   ```

4. Wait for the script to find a valid Nitro code. Once found, it will stop automatically.

5. Check the `valid_codes.txt` file for the valid Nitro code(s) found.

## Disclaimer

This script is provided for educational and informational purposes only. The use of this script may violate Discord's terms of service, and it may be considered unethical to use or distribute such tools. Use it at your own risk.

Please note that the generation of legitimate Discord Nitro codes is probabilistic, with each attempt having a 1 in 62^16 chance of success. Users should not expect to obtain a valid Nitro code from every run of the script.
